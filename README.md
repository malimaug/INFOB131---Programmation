# INFOB131 - Programmation
This repository contains a lot if not all the scripts and code snipets we had to write during class. The concerned course is INFOB131 given to first year students at the **computer science faculty of UNamur**. It is an introduction to basic coding skills particularly in python.

## Note
Feel free to use or inspire yourself with everything available in these files. But please mention my name and be aware that teachers dont always appreciate people that dont write their own code. I am not at all related to any sanctions you could get.
